# multithreaded-webserver
A multithreaded web server is a server that handles multiple client requests concurrently by using multiple threads. Each client request is processed in a separate thread, allowing the server to efficiently manage multiple connections without blocking. This improves responsiveness and scalability, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
